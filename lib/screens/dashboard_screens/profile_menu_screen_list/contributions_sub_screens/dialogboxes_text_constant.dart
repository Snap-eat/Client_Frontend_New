There might be a few reasons why your picture is no longer visible in the menu:

- the restaurant has requested to remove the picture 
as itâ€™s not an up-to-date representative of the dish. Sometimes presentation might change and we want our SnapEaters to see the food as it is, before they order it. 

- a SnapEater has reported that the dish no longer looks the same.""",
